# 203 List Maps

## Objectives
* creating a map from a list or tuple

Sometimes you may have a set of data that you want to iterate through, and then store the results for later use.  One possible way to do this would be to iterate through the list, and then do each of the tasks as you iterate through.  However, sometimes, it's more efficient to iterate through the list and store some data in a second list. If you don't need to use that second list more than once, why bother keeping a lot of memory tied up storing it?

Enter the map.  A map is created from a list or tuple, and behaves like a list or tuple, but *is only accessible once before it is cleared from memory*.

Take a look at sample1.py, and then answer the questions in your Google Doc file.
